Audio Aura:
The listener seems to have a good balance between high-energy and low-energy tracks indicating
that she  likes a variety of genres ranging from upbeat to relaxed and mellow songs.

The medium valence in the songs show a mix of positive and negative emotions in the music the
listener likes.

The high dancability score suggest the lister enjoys physical engagement into listening to music.


Why it might not be representative:
The observed timeframe is pretty small and peoples music tastes evolves over time. Hence the analysis
probably does not accurately reflect the listeners current preferences.

Basing the "audio aura" solely on the avergae for energy, valence and danceablity heavily
oversimplifies the complexity of music and individual listening prefecenes as well as the
resulting character traits.
